This program determines the distance between two proteins where 'distance' refers to differences/mutations occured. The differences mainly include insertions, deletions, substitutions.
Given two proteins, 'PLEASANTLY' and 'MEANLY', we have insertion (or deletion) which is indicated by having two proteins with different lenght. Also, it is OK to say that there is a substitutions where M is only observed in the one of the proteins.
